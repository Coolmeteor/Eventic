# Frontend Test Documentation

## Overview

This document summarizes the unit testing practices and coverage in our React application project. All tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/), aiming to ensure UI component correctness, stability, and user interaction reliability.

## Objective

- Verify that each component behaves as expected under typical and edge-case scenarios.
- Ensure that any changes in logic do not unintentionally break the UI.
- Improve maintainability by documenting test structure clearly.

## Environment

- Frontend Framework: React
- Language: TypeScript
- Testing Framework: Jest, @testing-library/react
