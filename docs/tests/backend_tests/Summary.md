# Frontend Test Documentation

## Overview

This document summarizes the unit testing practices and coverage in our React application project. All tests are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/), aiming to ensure UI component correctness, stability, and user interaction reliability.

## Objective

- Verify that each component behaves as expected under typical and edge-case scenarios.
- Ensure that any changes in logic do not unintentionally break the UI.
- Improve maintainability by documenting test structure clearly.

## Environment

- Frontend Framework: React
- Language: TypeScript
- Testing Framework: Jest, @testing-library/react
- Date: ******************************************

## Test Coverage
Write down the test converage percentage from the testing framework. For example:
```markdown
Unit Test Coverage (from Jest):
- Statements: 93%
- Branches: 87%
- Functions: 95%
- Lines: 93%
```

## Known Issues
Describe not tested/not fixed issues. For example:
```markdown
- Toast messages occasionally overlap on small screens
- Delay in error rendering due to debounce (to be fixed)
```

## Authors
Names whose worked on the frontend testing.
