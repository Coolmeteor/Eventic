# Precondition
- `global.fetch` is mocked for HTTP requests.
- `convertResponse` is mocked from `auth-api`.
- Sample event data is provided where needed for sorting tests.

# Postcondition
- Data is sorted correctly or returned based on fetch success.
- Undefined or empty array is returned when fetch fails.

# Error Handling / Edge Cases
- Fallback behavior (undefined or empty array) is tested for failed API calls.
- Sorting direction ("asc", "desc") correctness is verified.
