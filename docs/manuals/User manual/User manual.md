# Eventic introduction

Eventic is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform developed by Team 1. 


This platform brings together users and event organizers in a single, unified space. Users can browse and register for events, while event organizers can showcase and manage their events on the platform. This platform supports both free and paid event registration, and a ticketing system for event management.

It is recommended for organizers to fill out all fields, including event images for a full event page display.


Once finished, organizers can choose to save the event as a private draft, and come back to edit it later, or they can publish it right away, and the event will appear publicly on Eventic.

All details can be edited, including images.


At the bottom, the organizer has three choices.

- Delete: The event will be permanently removed form the platform





## Viewing event statistics and performance

The statistics page can be accessed through "Analytics", both in the "My Content" and the profile page.

This displays a summary of the event's performance. Organizers can view sales, and weekly and daily statistics as well. This page offers very filters based on time frame.

# Ticketing 

Users can view their tickets in the ordered tickets page.

This shows all the tickets the user has purchased. When attending events, users will need to show their QR code for event organizers to scan, as this is their ticket. Click on "View ticket" and then we offer a printout of the ticket.

For organizers, they may use the scan functionality to record tickets and grant users access to their event.
